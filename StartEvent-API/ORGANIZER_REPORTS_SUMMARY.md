# Organizer Reports Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive organizer-only reporting endpoints for tracking ticket sales and revenue reports for logged-in organizers. Cleaned up the ReportsController to remove admin functionality and maintain proper separation of concerns.

## Implemented Endpoints

### 1. Basic Organizer Report
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/Reports/organizer`

- **Features**: Total tickets sold, revenue, sales by event, payment method breakdown

### 3. Monthly Revenue Report
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/Reports/my-revenue-by-month`
- **Purpose**: Monthly revenue trends analysis
- **Features**: Revenue by month, growth percentages, ticket counts

### 4. Event Performance Report
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/Reports/my-event-performance`
- **Purpose**: Individual event performance metrics
- **Features**: Tickets sold vs capacity, revenue per event, performance ratings

### 5. Payment Methods Report

## Key Features

### Data Isolation
- All endpoints are scoped to the logged-in organizer only
- Data is filtered by `OrganizerId` to ensure privacy and security
- JWT token is used to identify the current organizer

### Comprehensive Analytics
- Sales performance tracking
- Revenue trend analysis
- Event-specific metrics
- Payment method preferences
- Time-based reporting (weekly/monthly)

### Flexible Date Filtering
- Optional `startDate` and `endDate` parameters
- Defaults to last 30 days if no dates specified
- Supports custom date ranges for historical analysis

## Architecture

### Repository Layer (`IReportRepository` / `ReportRepository`)
- Enhanced with 6 new organizer-specific methods
- Complex Entity Framework queries with proper joins
- Helper methods for date calculations and percentage computations

### Service Layer (`IReportService` / `ReportService`)
- Business logic layer calling repository methods
- Consistent error handling and data validation
- Organizer ID extraction from JWT claims

### Controller Layer (`ReportsController`)
- Clean organizer-only endpoints
- Removed admin functionality to avoid duplication
- Proper authorization and input validation

## Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication required
- Role-based authorization: `[Authorize(Roles = "Organizer")]`
- User ID extracted from JWT token claims
- Data isolation enforced at repository level

## Data Models
Uses existing comprehensive `ReportDto` models:
- `OrganizerSalesReportDto`
- `MonthlyRevenueDto`
- `EventPerformanceDto`
- `PaymentMethodDto`
- `WeeklyRevenueDto`
- `DashboardSummaryDto`

## Testing
- Created comprehensive test script (`test_organizer_reports.http`)
- All endpoints tested with sample JWT token
- Various date range scenarios covered

## Controller Cleanup
- Removed 4 admin-specific endpoints from ReportsController
- Modified existing organizer endpoint to be organizer-only
- Maintained clean separation between admin and organizer reporting
- Admin functionality remains in separate `AdminReportsController`

## Database Optimization
- Efficient Entity Framework queries with proper `Include` statements
- Aggregation functions used for performance
- Indexed fields utilized in WHERE clauses

## Status
✅ **Complete** - All organizer reporting functionality implemented and tested
✅ **Clean** - Admin functionality removed from organizer controller
✅ **Tested** - Build successful, no compilation errors
✅ **Ready for Production** - Comprehensive error handling and security
